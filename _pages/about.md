I am a Data Engineer/Scientist (Education Researcher) at [Avans University of Applied Science](https://www.avans.nl) and a PhD student in Computer Science working on Monitoring and Adaptation of Business Processes at [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl). I am passionate about Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

My educational background has been mainly in the field of Computer Science. I hold Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology Engineering (2011-2015) and Master of Science in Software Engineering (2015-2018) from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en). In my PhD, I have gained more insight on analyzing business processes such as process mining, predictive process monitoring and process adaptation as well as developing my research and presentation skills.

Apart from my studies, I have also worked in companies using different programming languages such as Python and Java as a data engineer and software engineer. Recently, I have been working as a Data Engineer/Scientist in the Institutional Research team collaborating with various teams and researchers. Previously, I have worked as an Android Software Developer for about a year and worked in the Internet of Things lab of Computer Engineering and Information Technology faculty of the Amirkabir University of Technology as a Software Engineer.

In my free time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly swimming, football, and running), traveling, and going out with friends and family. I grew up in [Tehran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran) and speak [Farsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language), English, Dutch and a bit of German. Currently, I live in the beautiful city of Den Bosch in the south of the Netherlands.
